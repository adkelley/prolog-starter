# Template for new SWI-Prolog projects

Before proceeding with the instructions below, be sure to download and install [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
## Instructions

To convert this template to your own project:
1. Replace the word *starter* with the name of your main program in both `Makefile` and `load.pl`.
2. Replace `src/starter.pl` and `src/substarter.pl` with your own main program.
3. Replace `src/starter.plt` and `src/substarter.plt` with your own tests.
4. Use `make <target>` where `<target>` is either `test`, `cov`, `repl`, or `args` to compile and run your program.

## Makefile explanation
1. `make test` will compile the source code, and run the unit tests.
2. `make cov` performs step 1 and, in addition, will print information about coverage by file (e.g., number of clauses).
3. `make repl` will compile the source code, and will start the Prolog top level (i.e., REPL).  Note that you can run a unit test(s) in the top level with [run_tests/1](https://www.swi-prolog.org/search?for=run_tests).
4. `make args ARGS="Module Goal ExtraArgs"` will compile the source code, and apply `Module:Goal` with the `ExtraArgs`. For example, `ARGS="starter string_uppercase 'hello'"` calls `starter:string_uppercase('hello', Result)`.  Note that `Result` is an unbound variable supplied by `load.pl`. Its possible to supply your own unbound variables, but it requires more pattern matching than what I've coded in `load.pl`.

## Coding Guidelines

 * Use empty imports (use_module(mymodule, [])) in order to not
   pollute the namespace.
 * Always use module prefixes (mymodule:predicate(...)) in order to
   clarify where things are coming from.
 * Always use the "made-up" module prefix "core:" when calling
   built-in predicates. This is completely unnecessary, and doesn't even
   work in all cases, but I think it is a good idea as long as it doesn't
   cause any problems. This decision may need to be revised when
   compatibility between different Prologs is investigated.
 * Avoid the if-then-else construct. It just looks ugly.
 * Avoid disjunctions. They are ugly, and can be replaced by properly
   written helpers. Think: premises are "and", clauses are "or".
 * Use cuts where appropriate, and try to keep each cut on a line by
   itself unless its placement is obvious and consistent in each clause.
   PlUnit is excellent at pointing out when tests succeed but leave
   choice points.
 * Try to avoid spaces within lists and structures, but always use
   spaces between arguments.
 * Predicates, atoms, etc. should use "this_naming_style" while variables
   should use "ThisNamingStyle".
 * Try to stick to the PlDoc structure.
 * If in doubt, consult: [Some Coding Guidelines for Prolog](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/sites/default/files/prolog_coding_guidelines.pdf)
